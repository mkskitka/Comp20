#Status Report 2


1. Accomplishments this week:
-Made a functional facebook login button for the home page
-Used google maps place services to find all nearby grocery stores and display markers on the map with basic information in info windows (name of store, address, distance from user, open or not, rating)
-Used bootstrap on the Create page to allow user to type in information about a recipe, add rows as needed for their list of ingredients, and upload a picture (POST is not yet functional)
-Learned through Assignment 3 how to serve web content and handle GET/POST requests using nodejs and Heroku
-Made an app on Heroku that serves the web page so far, and in the future will handle all GET/POST request and store recipes and profiles in a database

2. Challenges we faced:
-Haven't figured out the best database to use that can store pictures as well as text
-Though the Facebook login button is functional, have not yet figured out a way to log out on the web page
-Figuring out git pull as we all work on the project in different stages
-Maintaining links to other html and css files after pushing everything to Heroku (was solved by putting all static files in the public folder)

3. Goals for next week:
Julia- Figure out how to make a facebook log out button
Julia- Figure out how to link profiles to facebook logins, and eventually create a method to post profile information and a database to store profile pictures and bios
Ben- Pin down what databases we should use and the format of the data we want to be stored
Ben- Let user post recipes and store these recipes in database
Emily- Figure out how to use bootstrap for styling and maintain a fixed header that shows up on all pages
Mary Kate- Find way to load asynchronus content on home page
Mary Kate- Figure out how to put a search bar on the home page and filter through recipes in database based on search tag
