-Modified create page to better suit database storing of information


2. Challenges we faced:

-Once recipes can be stored:
  -Implement search algorithm to look for recipes based on a tag (Mary)
  -Look into client-side data persistence with local storage for the search bar (keeping track of what the user last searched)
  -Implement asynchronous content loading on home page feed (Mary)
-Once profile data can be stored:
  -Allow user to upload a profile picture and bio (Julia)
  -Link recipes to the user that posted them and display all user's recipes on their profile page (Julia)
  -Look into sending a confirmation email to a user when they log in for the first time and create a profile (Julia)
-Use bootstrap more for page styling (Ben and Emily)
-Figure out how to get Facebook login button and functionality on navigation bar (Emily)

#Comments by Ming
* From your status report 2: "Let user post recipes and store these recipes in database" => has this been done?
* "Link recipes to the user that posted them and display all user's recipes on their profile page " => this is more important than uploading picture and bio.
