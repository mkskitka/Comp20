1. Using google maps API we added a map page that uses geo location to find the user's location and pan the map to that location. 
The user's location is marked with a marker and eventurally we will have displayed all the locations of grocery stores within 5 miles of
the user.
We met with our group to allocate tasks to finish for this coming Monday.

2.Issues we faced were finding a time to meet up to discuss what we wanted to do next. We are having issues figuring out the right
