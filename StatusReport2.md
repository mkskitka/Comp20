#Status Report 2


1. Accomplishments this week:
-Made a functional facebook login button for the home page
-Used google maps place services to find all nearby grocery stores and display markers on the map with basic information in info windows (name of store, address, distance from user, open or not, rating)
-Used bootstrap on the Create page to allow user to type in information about a recipe, add rows as needed for their list of ingredients, and upload a picture (POST is not yet functional)
-Learned through Assignment 3 how to serve web content and handle GET/POST requests using nodejs and Heroku
-Made an app on Heroku to, in the future, handle all GET/POST request and store all recipes and profiles in a database

2. Challenges we faced:
-Haven't figured out the best database to use that can store pictures as well as text
-Though the Facebook login button is functional, have not yet figured out a way to log out on the web page
-Figuring out git pull as we all work on the project in different stages
-Maintaining links to other html and css files after pushing everything to Heroku (was solved by putting all static files in the public folder)


3. Goals for next week:
-Figure out how to make a facebook log out button
-Pin down what database we should use and the format of the data we want to be stored
-Let user post recipes and store these recipes in database
-Figure out how to use bootstrap for styling and maintain a fixed header that shows up on all pages
