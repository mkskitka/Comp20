1.I have implemented all elements correctly except for some reason when I run my program on my own server with the python command,
my css file is not implemented, however when I display the index.html file the css attributes show up.

2. I collaborated with Ben Pfander to discuss the order of functions that are called in my program

3. This lab took me 2-3 hours
ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS:
4.For part 2 and 3 of the lab, the messages did not render and should not render due to the same origin policy. 
With part two, a browser is a different origin than my computer 
and therefore it can not receive data from my local files. 
For part 3, the origin is diffent as the data is coming from a different origin in the form
of a url and therefore my computer can not receive the information.
